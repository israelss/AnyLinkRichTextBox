AnyLinkRichTextBox
==================

A rich text box control which recognizes any link

=============
Features:
* Recognizes any link which starts with a protocol (http://|https://|etc...) or without protocol, but starting with `www. (www.example.com)`
* Recognizes mail like links, for example `user@company.com` with **mailto:** protocol being optional
* Recognizes IP like links, for example `255.255.255.255`
* Recognizes any custom link within delimiters. The default delimiters are in Markdown style, for example `[Friendly text](Hyperlink text)`
* Doesn't allow two or more links to be placed next each other without any spaces
