AnyLinkRichTextBox
==================

A rich text box control which recognizes any link

=============
Features:
1. Recognizes any link which starts with a protocol (http://|https://|etc...) or without protocol, but starting with **www.** (www.example.com)
2. Recognizes mail like links, for example _user@company.com_ with **mailto:** protocol being optional
3. Recognizes IP like links, for example _255.255.255.255_
4. Recognizes any custom link within delimiters. The default delimiters are in Markdown style, for example _[Friendly text] (Hyperlink text)_
